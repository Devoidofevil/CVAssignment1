To run the file :- Kindly make the following changes-
  1)Change the path on line 4 to wherever you have saved the input images
  2)Change the path on line 21 to wherver you have saved the test image
 
Note:- Test Images are 1-14.jpg
       Training image is 15.jpg
       
Important:- Due to the nature of the pen, the segmented pen only includes the blue part of the pen shown in the images.
The real world size of the blue part only is 11.87 cm.
As such the best accuracy we have obtained among the test images is on 15.jpg, the length came up to 11.84 cm. i.e a 99.97% Accuracy.
       
The program will run on Matlab 2015+. 

Thank You
